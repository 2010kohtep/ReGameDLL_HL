# ReGameDLL_HL
Adapted [Half-Life 1 SDK](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife) for compiling GameDLL libraries. Unnecessary files deleted, Visual Studio support added.

## What is this?
ReGameDLL_HL can be used as a template project for other mods. It can also be used as a full-fledged Half-Life 1 mod.

Half-Life 1 SDK was practically not modified to preserve the original code, so all the functionality and all the errors that are present in the original SDK also exist here.

## Credits
I want to thank [ReGameDLL_CS](https://github.com/s1lentq/ReGameDLL_CS/) project for inspiration.
